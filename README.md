# React + Webpack + Typescript Starter

Based loosely on the [Pluralsight React Fundamentals Course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-fundamentals) by [Liam McLennan](https://github.com/liammclennan).
I did not complete the full Author quiz, as I didn't want to make a full application just get a non-trivial starter for anyone who may want to see how it can work.

## Code
